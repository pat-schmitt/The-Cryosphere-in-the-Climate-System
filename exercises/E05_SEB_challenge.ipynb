    "The turbulent flux section is a bit more complicated, and to save your time for the thinking, it is mainly done for you. Do have a look at the code used though as it is a chance to learn by understanding how the equations are represented in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the turbulent heat fluxes are not measured directly (e.g. using eddy correlation systems), they have to be estimated. In the lecture we discussed the main components controlling these fluxes by referring to how the formulae look if you know the empirically derived 'transfer coefficients' for heat and moisture. These are also usually not known due to the difficulty of measuring fluxes directly, so more commonly the turbulent fluxes are estimated using methods that are based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The flux gradient theory is elaborated in section 5.3.6.2 of the Physics of Glaciers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will use this so-called “bulk method“ to compute the turbulent heat fluxes by using the following analytical expressions (for neutral conditions) adjusted from the equations shown in the Physics of Glaciers to account for the fact that not all of our relevent variables are measured at the same height:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E_H = c_p \\rho_0  \\frac{P}{P_0} \\frac{k^2 u (T_a - T_s)}{ln(z_m / z0_m) ln(z_h/z0_h)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$E_E = 0.623 L \\rho_0  \\frac{1}{P_0} \\frac{k^2 u (e_a - e_s)}{ln(z_m / z0_m) ln(z_v/z0_v)}$\n",
    " \n",
    "Lets break these down and consider the terms one at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the $E_H$ equation, we can see the governing gradient in temperature $(T_a - T_s)$ and the wind speed $u$ as well as the heat capacity and density of air, which together express the volumetric heat capacity of the air at 0°C at se level pressure. This is scaled to the measurement site by the $\\frac{P}{P_0}$ term. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the $E_E$ equation, we can see the governing gradient in moisture $(e_a - e_s)$. This moisture gradient is expressed as vapor pressure, because this is convinent to use over a frozen water surface as we know the vapor pressure here will be saturation for the given surface temperature. There is also wind speed $u$ again, and we use the latent heat $L$ of sublimation or vaporisation depending on the surface. The numerical term is the ratio of the moelcular weight of water to air, and we use the reference air density and pressure again to scale to our measurement site.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other terms are involved in describing the typical logarithmic profile of windspeed above the surface, that is used in this bulk method, hence the $ln$ terms, and roughness $z0$ related terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing is a constant known as vón Kármáns constant, $k$, then $z_m$, $z_h$ and $z_v$ are simply the heights (in m) of the sensors (wind speed and temperature respectively). $z0_m$, $z0_h$ and $z0_v$ are related to roughness properties of the surface. The parameter $z0_m$ is the roughness length of momentum (in m) and is a measure of the aerodynamic roughness of the surface, which we talked about in the lecture. It is defined as the height above the surface where the extrapolated logarithmic profile of wind speed is equal to zero. The scalar roughness lengths of heat, $z0_h$ and moisture $z0_v$ (in m) indicate the height above the surface where the logarithmic profile of the respective variable reaches the surface value. Some studies appeal to using identical values for these parameters (as is done for simplicity in the explanation in the Physics of Glaciers), but most evidence suggests that they differ, and so we account for that here.\n",
